## ðŸ“„ Description

I developed a full-stack AI-Powered Resume Builder Application using Next.js with its built-in server-side capabilities. This application helps users create professional resumes effortlessly, with world-class resume formats and full CRUD operation support. I integrated Google Gemini AI so that users can effortlessly generate professional resume descriptions using AI assistance. The system also provides intelligent skill suggestions based on the userâ€™s resume title.

This application solves a major problem for beginners who are unsure about how a professional resume format should look. Many struggle with designing layouts or structuring their information effectively. With this app, they donâ€™t need to worry about formatting at all â€” they simply fill in their information, and the system automatically generates a professional resume in a world-class format. Users can then easily download the resume as a PDF, ready to use for job applications.
